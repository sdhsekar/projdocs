live stream. video, any connections?
"live stream is to deliver video frome by frame from the server to the client"

raw data (RTMP, WebRTC) => processing (watermark, filter, change face)  => compression (H.264, ACC) => stream push (FLV,RTMP,HLS) => stream play (Native H5)

how can we play the vide source in web?
	Flash +FLV 
		low latency
		Deprecated
	Video + HLS
		High latency
		good compatibility im Mobile
		
	Video + MPEG-DASH
		low la
		bad com
		
		
	Http Live Streaming (HLS)
	
		Control index File: m3u8
			Video format: ts
			Video Codec: H264
			Audio codec: MP3,AAC,AC3

		starter-kit
		based on best practice of our team and react
		(pure render, touch event, devtool...)
